##first problem: repeating itself --> create a for loop

##N is our starting population size

N <- 100

##We will create a for loop so we don't repeat type code for every single year
##B will represent births for the year, D will represent deaths for the year, and then we will print our results of our final population after 10 years

(for(i in 1:10){
  print(paste("The year is", i))
  B <- round(rnorm(1, 3, 1), 0)
  print(paste("There were", B, "births"))
  D <- round(rnorm(1, 3, 1), 0)
  print(paste("There were", D, "deaths"))
  N <- N + B - D
  print(paste("The population size changed to", N))
}

print(N)
